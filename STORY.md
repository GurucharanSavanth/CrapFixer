# A Personal Note from the Developer

I’ve developed a lot of open-source apps for Windows. Some came quickly, but many were also discontinued just as fast. Most of my open source projects focused on Windows fine-tuning and customization. Many people on GitHub wonder why I’ve created so many apps one after another. I’ve received a lot of messages about it, but I haven’t been able to respond.

My latest project is **CrapFixer** and it‘s meant to be the last one in this area, replacing everything else. I’ve slowly grown up, and so has this project.

My answer to many of your questions is actually quite personal — as strange as that might sound. We’re all human, struggling every day with our own burdens. We have to keep going, keep functioning, distract ourselves, and heal.

It took me a long time to heal after losing my mother a few years ago. For days on end, I just worked, really worked and coded through countless nights. Every single minute, I needed a distraction. I only went to bed when my eyes simply couldn’t stay open any longer. Distraction was the only thing that mattered, no matter the cost. Sometimes, I’d drive deep into the woods, where no one could find me, hear me, or see me. I left everything behind — my worries, my grief, my life — until there was nothing left but me and the machine. I completely threw myself into programming as a way to escape and keep going.

Many of my projects will never be visible here on GitHub; others you might know. There were times when I felt really low and had strange thoughts. Then I would look for a new distraction to keep from giving up. It went on like that for weeks, months, years — and now I’m here.

It’s kind of crazy when I think back: this project, **CrapFixer** – even though it didn’t really have a name back then – is old. Older than this story. It reminds me of a time when everything still felt right, when I was genuinely happy.

Maybe it will outlive all of us. 🙂🚗

I only truly understood life late in my 30s, but I never gave up. Coding may have even saved my life. I’m still here. And I have to admit, I’m also thankful to Microsoft and the whole Windows platform as they’ve been also a big part of my journey alongside other tools

**Don’t take life too seriously, let people live. Everyone’s character is different; everyone just wants to live. A simple “hello” to someone you don’t know can work wonders. You never know what’s going on inside that person’s soul or what they might be going through.**

And maybe it’s worth remembering: **behind every piece of code, every project, every bit of tech, there’s often a deeply human story.**
