# the tool that says what everyoneâ€™s thinking

Remember the days when you'd run a registry cleaner even if you didn't really need it? (Or maybe we did need it? I was probably too young to figure that out, too young for that crap ðŸ˜…)
Back then, cleaner tools like CCleaner were everywhere, it felt like every other tech forum had a "top 10 Windows Optimizers" list.

You'd think that stuff would be over by now with sleek, modern OSes like Windows 11.Wellâ€¦ the built-in Windows cleaner might be enough, sure.
But instead, the "modern OS" blesses us with a whole new batch of problems: ads in the Start menu, creepy data collection, preinstalled junk apps you didn't ask for and can't easily remove.
Kind of wild that we still need tools like this in 2025. And they don't even sound that different,like this one here: Crapfixer.
What can I say? The tech world is a bitch.

This is my personal little IT toolbox that I've been using for years to clean up and tweak Windows systems i work on. The tool is about 7 years old, but I've given the codebase a full refresh, especially tuned for Windows 11 (works on W10 too). I also removed most of the old enterprise scripts, so what you're seeing now is a lightweight, easy-to-use, and safe app. Almost every change you make can be undone, so you can tweak without fear.

Crapfixer still looks like something straight out of the Windows XP era (maybe CCleaner ðŸ˜„) â€” and honestly, that's exactly the vibe I was going for. Sometimes simple just beats fancy. Two clicks: 'Analyze', check the results, 'Fix' â€” done. No drama, no bloat.

While cleaning up my GitHub (30+ repos down to 20 now), I also cleaned up thousands of lines of old code. Some projects come and go, but Crapfixer stays. It's fast, simple, and basically bulletproof. I haven't managed to break anything yet. ðŸ˜‰
If you like old-school tools that just work, youre gonna feel right at home
If there's enough interest, I'll also commit the updated code to GitHub soon

# How to use

When you launch the tool, all options are pre-enabled to save you the hassle of clicking around.
1. All you really need to do is hit "Analyze";the tool checks your system status and compares it with the selected options.
Anything marked in red still needs fixing. Gray means it's already set up on your system.
2. Then just smash that "Run CFixer!" button and you're good to go.
