# FeatureFixer
Here's my little private IT toolbox that I use to clean up and tweak Windows systems I work on. This tool is old but packed with over 100 tweaks. Ive disabled many of them for now, leaving only the mainstream features that everyone can use. For some reason, the faster tech evolves and UI designs change, the more I find myself missing the good old classic interfaces.

The FeatureFixer looks like the original CCleaner from the XP days, and honestly, thats all I've ever needed. Two clicks: "Analyze", glance at the results, then hit "Fix". Simple, effective, and fast.
I'm currently tidying up my GitHub repo (I started with 30 repos, now only 20 are online). I'm also doing some spring cleaning on my personal projects. Thousands of lines of code have been wiped in the process ðŸ˜‰, but some things will always remain. like the FeatureFixer.
It's practically impossible to mess up with it. I haven't been able to break anything yet. Plus, everything is reversible
