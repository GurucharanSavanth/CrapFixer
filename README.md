# the tool that says what everyone's thinking
## the tool Microsoft would build, if they hated bloatware as much as we do

Remember the days when you'd run a registry cleaner even if you didn't really need it? (Or maybe we did need it? I was probably too young to figure that out, too young for that crap ðŸ˜…).
Back then, cleaner tools like CCleaner were everywhere - it felt like every other tech forum had a "top 10 Windows Optimizers" list.

You'd think that stuff would be over by now with sleek, modern OSes like Windows 11. Well... the built-in Windows cleaner might be enough, sure.
But instead, the "modern OS" blesses us with a whole new batch of problems: ads in the Start menu, creepy data collection, preinstalled junk apps you didn't ask for and can't easily remove.
It's kind of wild that we still need tools like this in 2025. And they don't even sound that different, like this one here: Crapfixer.
What can I say? The tech world is a bitch.

Enter **Crapfixer**.

This isn't just another cleaner. It's my personal IT toolbox, honed over 7+ years and recently given a full refresh, especially for Windows 11 (it also works great on Windows 10). I've stripped out the old enterprise scripts, resulting in a **lightweight, easy-to-use, and safe application**. The best part? **Almost every change you make can be undone**, so you can tweak without fear.

Crapfixer proudly sports a look from the Windows XP era (think CCleaner vibes!) - and that's intentional. Sometimes, simple just beats fancy. It's all about **two clicks: 'Analyze', review, 'Fix' - done.** No drama, no bloat.

While cleaning up my GitHub (slashing 30+ repos down to 20 and tidying thousands of lines of code), Crapfixer is one of the keepers. It's fast, straightforward, and practically bulletproof. (Seriously, I haven't managed to break anything with it yet. ðŸ˜‰)

If you appreciate old-school tools that just _work_, you're going to feel right at home.

_Heads up: The updated code for Crapfixer will be committed to GitHub soon if there's enough community interest!_
